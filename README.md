I literally wrote this app in like 20 mins as a joke.
If you wanna run this app for some stupid reason.
Read the following.
## Running
#### Step 1
Clone the Project and inside the project directory run: 
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
#### Step 2
Once Expo is installed run:
```
npm install 
```
#### Step 3 
Once those things are done. You are ready to start the app.
Just run the following command:
```
npm start
```
Thats it.
